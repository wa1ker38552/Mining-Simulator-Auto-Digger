# Mining-Simulator-Auto-Digger
Basically a revamp of rebirth grinder

**What It Does**
Basically, it just uses keyboard and mouse actions to dig, sell, and teleport to get currency in Mining Simulator 2. It detects when your backpack is full by reading your backpack size using Pytesseract.

**Getting Started**
1. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/wa1ker38552/Mining-Simulator-Auto-Digger`
2. Install pytesseract
3. Add your path into `pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd`
4. Make sure in Roblox, you camera is pointed down at your character,  make sure you have a teleportation pad placed in front of you and selected
5. Press 'q' to start
6. The program should automatically start pressing the teleport button, just move your mouse a little bit for it to select
7. Once it clicked the teleport button on its own, press 'q' again to run the main loop
